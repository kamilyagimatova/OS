Program 1 write: Hello
		 Hello
Program 2 write: Hello
	 	  
		 
In this case use line buffering because in first case when program ask to write Hello, program don't do it, but when it ask to write \n 2 processes write from buffer Hello and \n (write line by line).
In second case when program ask to write Hello\n then program do it and after it 2 processes write just \n because buffer is empty.
