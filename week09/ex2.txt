For increasing the same pages will go in a row. 
example: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 1 2 1 6 3
should: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 (it is not obligatory in ascending order)
maybe also: 4 5 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 6
For decreasing the same pages should be as far as possible:
example: 1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6
should: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2
but if we have for our example 4 frames => it will decrease
if 8 frames => it will be the same
