For increasing the same pages will go in a row because then the second repeating of page always will be in page frame => number of page faults is number of different pages  
example: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 1 2 1 6 3
should: 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 4 5 6 (it is not obligatory in ascending order)
maybe also: 4 5 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 3 3 6

For decreasing the same pages should be as far as possible because when we check repeating of page 100(for example), page 100 will not be in the page frame(it is not always, if frame is little then it doesn't work) 
example: 1 1 2 3 4 4 5 6
should: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2
but if we have for our example 4 frames => it will decrease
if 8 frames => it will be the same
