We see the tree of processes. Our program run 8 times, because in the first step the first process creates another one(called it 2), then in the second step 1 creates another one(called it 3), 2 creates another one(called it 4), then in the third step each of processes 1, 2, 3, 4 create another one(5, 6, 7, 8).
1) 1 -> 2
2) 1 -> 3
   2 -> 4
3) 1 -> 5
   2 -> 6
   3 -> 7
   4 -> 8
